Info: Command: quartus_map --read_settings_files=on --write_settings_files=off MKRVIDOR4000 -c MKRVIDOR4000
Info (16303): Aggressive Performance optimization mode selected -- timing performance will be prioritized at the potential cost of increased logic area and compilation time
Warning (18236): Number of processors has not been specified which may cause overloading on shared machines.  Set the global assignment NUM_PARALLEL_PROCESSORS in your QSF to an appropriate value for best performance.
Info (20030): Parallel compilation is enabled and will use 4 of the 4 processors detected
